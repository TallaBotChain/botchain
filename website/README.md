# BotChain Doc Website

Docusaurus website we could use for smart-contract docs.

## Local Setup

Clone the botchain repo to your local workspace by running:
```
git clone git@github.com:TallaBotChain/botchain.git ~/
```
Move into the botchain/website directory:
```
cd ~/botchain/website && npm install
```
Launch the server on localhost:
```
npm start
```

The local server should be launched on localhost:3000 and the script should open the default
docs page in your default browser.
