# DeveloperRegistry

Truffle project for the botchain smart contracts (solidity)

## Setup

Make sure you have the following installed globally:

node 8

TestRPC 6: `npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

Then run `npm install`

### Compile

Recompile contracts and build artifacts.

```
$ npm run compile
```

### Deploy

Deploy contracts to RPC provider at port `8546`.

```
$ npm run deploy
```

### Test

Run `npm run compile` before first test run, and after any changes to the `.sol` files

```
$ npm test
```

Run `npm run test:coverage` to run with coverage reporting

### Deployment

* `npm run deploy:development` - deploy to local TestRPC
* `npm run deploy:kovan` - deploy to kovan testnet
* `npm run deploy:rinkeby-infura` - deploy to rinkeby testnet via infura service
* `npm run deploy:mainnet` - deploy to mainnet

### Rinkeby-Infura Deployment Setup

Add `secrets.json` to the project root

```
// secrets.json
{
  "mnemonic": "<some mnemonic>",
  "infura_apikey": "<your infura key>"
}
```

Go to https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/, click "Generate". Add `BIP39 Mnemonic` to `"mnemonic"` value in `secrets.json`

Add address from the BIP39 page to MetaMask. Send it some rinkeby Ether, or get it from the faucet on https://www.rinkeby.io

Go to https://infura.io/register.html to register for Infura. Paste your API key into `"infura_apikey"` value in `secrets.json`

`npm run deploy-rinkeby` to deploy to rinkeby

A deployed contract for DeveloperRegistry functionality

### ActivatableRegistry

An extension contract for creating a registry of activatable entries

### ApprovableRegistry

An extension contract for creating a registry of approvable entries

### BotCoinPayableRegistry

An extension contract for BotCoinPayment functionality

### OwnableRegistry

A registry of token ID's that are owned by another token from a different registry

### OwnerRegistry
