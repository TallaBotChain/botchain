# Botchain

Botchain is a registration, identification, and audit enablement platform built
using the Ethereum blockchain. Botchain aims to provide a management platform for 
enterprise bots to ensure that businesses have a robust, efficient, and secure system.
Libraries provided by this repository will aid bot developers to incorporate Botchain
capabilities into their bots so that businesses can utilize the management capabilities
according to their needs.

The Botchain platform aims to provide businesses with management capabilities such
as audit trails of actions (i.e. what they did and why), identity management, knowledge
sharing, and potentially skill sharing.
